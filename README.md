# Employment-in-Manufacturing---Tableau
A dashboard to communicate changes within manufacturing employment within the UK

Using a large dataset of job changes within the UK, I focused on all sectors that involved some form of manufacturing, to derive insights related to the growth of manufacturing in the UK in general.

This bar chart visualises changes across the various manufacturing sectors in the UK.

And this map represents where these sectors are growing in the UK, and how much. Why is it black and red? It looks cool.
